# Algorithms
The Algorithm Selector is a simple command-line program written in C that allows users to select and run algorithms. It provides a list of available algorithms and prompts the user to enter the name of the algorithm they want to run. The program then displays the selected algorithm.

1. Quick Sort: Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It has an average and best-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the fastest sorting algorithms.

2. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a graph from a source node to all other nodes. It has a time complexity of O(V^2) or O(E log V) with a min-priority queue, where V represents the number of vertices and E represents the number of edges in the graph.

3. Prim's Algorithm: Prim's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph. It has a time complexity of O(V^2) or O(E log V) with a binary heap, where V represents the number of vertices and E represents the number of edges in the graph.

4. Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming): The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that aims to maximize the value of items packed into a knapsack, given their weights and values. It can be solved using dynamic programming techniques, with a time complexity of O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum capacity of the knapsack.

5. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): FFT is an efficient algorithm for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence or its inverse. It has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n represents the number of elements in the input sequence.
